# GaiaXPcorrection

GaiaDR3XPspectracorrectionV1 is an astronomy Python package to provide a correction
for the Gaia DR3 XP spectra. The corrected spectra can significantly eliminate the 
systematic errors of the original Gaia DR3 XP spectra, please refer to our 
paper (Huang et al. 2024) for more details. 

We can give robust corrections for sources in the roughly following range:
−0.5 < BP − RP < 2
3 < G < 17.5 
E(B − V) < 0.8
Sources that do not fall into this range are not tested for the correctness of the 
corrections given by the correction package.
